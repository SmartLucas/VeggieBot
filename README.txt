VeggieBot
=========

Bot coded for Turntable.fm with the powerful magic of the Turntable-API. This bot wouldn't be possible without 
the nice people at this GitHub repository, https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API. 
They helped me get the code working perfectly with no bugs so far. 

This code is now for show and tell.
It will help people learn Javascript since Turntable.fm closed down on December 2, 2013
